# dat init

1. Before you do anything, run `ls -a` to print out the contents of this folder.

2. There should be nothing in here.

3. Now run `dat init`. You will be prompted to enter a few pieces of optional information.

4. Dat should have created a file called `dat.json` as well as a folder called `.dat`.

5. Run `ls -a` again and make sure you can see both of these.

`dat.json` is for settings and configuration for this dat. The `.dat` folder is where the dat data actually lives. The reason it starts with a `.` is to denote that it is a hidden folder.
